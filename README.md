# 2018 Departmental Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset of 2018 sales transactions. I transformed a "dirty" raw dataset into a professional, interactive dashboard to identify performance trends across five departments.

## Technical Skills Used
•⁠  ⁠Data Cleaning: Removed non-numeric characters and corrected data types for accurate summation.
.  Duplicate Removal: Identifeid and removed duplciate records and blank entries to prevent inflated sales figures.
•⁠  ⁠PivotTables: Aggregated sales data by Department and Quarter.
•⁠  ⁠Data Visualization:* Developed a Clustered Column PivotChart to show comparative performance.

## Key Insights
•⁠  ⁠Top Performer: The Dance department led the year with $205,998 in total sales.
•⁠  ⁠Growth: The Sport department saw a significant recovery, growing from $21,909 in Q1 to over $64,000 by Q3.
•⁠  ⁠Consistency: The Balance department maintained the most stable revenue stream throughout the fiscal year.
